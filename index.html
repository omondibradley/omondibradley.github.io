	<h1 id="about">WHAT I AM ABOUT</h1>
	<p>
		Bradley Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929-present) is an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1954 through 1968. I am best known for my role in the advancement of civil rights using the tactics of nonviolence and civil disobedience based on my Christian beliefs and inspired by the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.

<p>I became a civil rights activist early in my career. I led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. With the SCLC, I led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. I also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, where I delivered my famous "I Have a Dream" speech.</p>

<p>On October 14, 1964, I received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance.[1] In 1965, he helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches, and the following year he and the SCLC took the movement north to Chicago to work on segregated housing. </p>

<p>I was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in my honor, and a county in Washington State was also rededicated for me.</p>

You have it all or you are not free."[314]</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p>In 1957, I was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[315] Two years later, I won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for his book Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story.[316] In 1966, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America awarded King the Margaret Sanger Award for "My courageous resistance to bigotry and my lifelong dedication to the advancement of social justice and human dignity."[317] Also in 1966, King was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[318] In November 1967 I made a 24-hour trip to the United Kingdom to receive an honorary degree from Newcastle University, being the first African-American to be so honoured by Newcastle.[319] In a moving impromptu acceptance speech,[320] I said</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p>There are three urgent and indeed great problems that we face not only in the United States of America but all over the world today. That is the problem of racism, the problem of poverty and the problem of war.</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p>In 1971 I was posthumously awarded a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for his Why I Oppose the War in Vietnam.[321]</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p>I am the conscience of my generation. I gazed upon the great wall of segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of my fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, I wrung my eloquent statement of my dream for America. I make our nation stronger because I make it better.</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p>I was second in Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century.[324] In 1963, I was named Time Person of the Year, and in 2000, I was voted sixth in an online "Person of the Century" poll by the same magazine.[325] I placed third in the Greatest American contest conducted by the Discovery Channel and AOL.[326]</p></li></ul>
